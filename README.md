### **Introduction**

#### **Background and Context**

Lighting plays a crucial role in shaping the ambiance, mood, and functionality of indoor spaces. The ability to choose the right lighting color can significantly impact the aesthetic appeal and comfort of a room. However, selecting the ideal light color is often a challenging and time-consuming process, requiring trial-and-error installations or relying on theoretical visualizations. Augmented Reality (AR) technology offers an innovative solution to this problem by enabling users to visualize various lighting conditions in real-time within their actual spaces.

Advancements in AR, coupled with image processing techniques such as Statistical Color Transfer, provide a robust framework for developing interactive and user-friendly applications. These applications have the potential to revolutionize traditional practices in interior design, empowering users to make data-driven decisions while saving time, money, and resources. This project focuses on the development of an AR-based application that enables users to experiment with and select room light colors by providing real-time feedback.

#### **Literature Review**

Research in AR and lighting technologies underscores the importance of immersive experiences in enhancing decision-making. Studies highlight the efficacy of AR in bridging the gap between digital visualization and real-world implementation, particularly in design-oriented fields. Similarly, image processing techniques, such as Statistical Color Transfer, have been employed in various domains, from color grading in photography to personalized design systems. 

#### **Research Problem**

We want to let the users understand how the room will look once the color of light is selected. This helps the users to buy the perfect shade of light for the room.

#### **Research Objectives**

The primary objective of this research is to create an AR application that:

* Enables users to visualize various light color shades and temperatures in real-time.  
* Utilizes Statistical Color Transfer techniques to enhance the accuracy of light color rendering.  
* Provides a user-centric interface that fosters intuitive interactions and informed decision-making.  
* Reduces resource waste by eliminating the need for physical trials of lighting options.

#### **Research Questions**

The study is guided by the following research questions:

1. How can AR technology be effectively utilized to simulate different lighting conditions in indoor spaces?  
2. What role does Statistical Color Transfer play in enhancing the realism and accuracy of AR-based light color visualizations?  
3. How does the application improve user experience and decision-making compared to traditional lighting selection methods?

#### **Theoretical Framework**

The project is underpinned by theories of visual perception and human-computer interaction (HCI), which emphasize the importance of immersive and interactive design in enhancing user satisfaction. Additionally, the Statistical Color Transfer technique forms the core computational framework, enabling seamless color transformations that mimic real-world lighting conditions.

#### **Research Methodology**

The AR application is developed using a combination of software engineering and image processing techniques. The methodology involves:

* Designing the AR interface to allow users to select and visualize different lighting options in real-time.  
* Implementing Statistical Color Transfer algorithms to adjust room lighting colors dynamically.  
* Conducting usability tests to evaluate the application’s performance and user satisfaction.

#### **Scope and Limitations**

The study focuses on indoor spaces and does not account for outdoor lighting scenarios or advanced light modeling involving shadows and reflections. The app’s functionality is limited to smartphones with AR capabilities, which may restrict its accessibility for users without compatible devices.

#### **Contributions and Significance**

This research contributes to the fields of AR, interior design, and sustainable technology by providing a practical tool that enhances user empowerment and resource efficiency. The app offers a novel approach to lighting selection, addressing a gap in the current market and advancing the integration of AR with image processing techniques.
